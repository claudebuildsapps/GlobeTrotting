        "description": "The legal environment for digital nomads in Lisbon is very good, with clear pathways to legal residency and favorable tax treatment.\n\nPortugal's Digital Nomad Visa provides a clear legal framework specifically designed for remote workers. Requirements include proving regular income of at least €3,040/month (four times the minimum wage), health insurance, and proof of accommodation. The process takes 2-3 months on average.\n\nThe NHR (Non-Habitual Resident) tax scheme offers significant advantages, with a flat 20% tax rate on most income for 10 years. This provides tax predictability and potential savings compared to many other European countries.\n\nResidency processes are well-established though can involve bureaucracy. The SEF (immigration office) handles applications, and while processes have been modernizing, some steps still require in-person visits and paper documentation.\n\nLegal assistance is readily available, with many law firms specializing in helping digital nomads and offering English-language services. Typical costs for full visa assistance range from €1,000-2,000 depending on complexity."
