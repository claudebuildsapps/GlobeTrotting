This file is a placeholder for the preview image.

For Vercel to properly serve your preview image:

1. Create a JPG image named "preview.jpg" (1200x630 pixels)
2. Place it in the PUBLIC directory (not in a subdirectory)
3. Replace this text file with the actual image
4. Make sure the image is properly committed and pushed
