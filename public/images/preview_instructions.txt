You need to create a preview image file called "preview.png" and place it in this directory:
/Users/joshkornreich/Documents/Mary moves/public/images/

Image Specifications:
- File name: preview.png
- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (standard Open Graph image size)
- Format: PNG with transparent background preferred
- Content: Create an image showing a world map or digital nomad concept with text "Digital Nomad Location Comparison"
- Design: Use the earth tone color palette from the app (deep purple, forest green, amber gold)
- Include: Some visual elements representing the different locations (Athens, Lisbon, Sofia, etc.)

After creating the image:
1. Place it in this directory
2. Commit and push it to GitHub
3. The image URL in the meta tags is set to:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claudebuildsapps/globe-streaming/main/public/images/preview.png

Alternatives if you can't create a custom image:
1. Use an existing image from the project
2. Use a free stock image related to digital nomads or global locations
3. Create a simple text-based image with the title

Note: For the image to work in Telegram and other platforms, it must be publicly accessible at the URL specified in the meta tags.
